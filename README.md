Case_conversion_in_files.c opens a file, convert all the lowercase characters into uppercase, and then save as a new file.

Case_insensitive_string_search.c searches for a target string within another string, whether the characters are uppercase or lowercase.

Count_characters_in_files.c opens a file and counts the number of characters it contains.

Create_temporary_files.c creates a temporary file, then closes and deletes it when the program terminates.

Decimal_to_binary_conversion.c converts decimal intergers into binary numbers.

Element_wise_array_addition.c gives the element-wise addition for arrays of the same size.

File_copying.c copies everything from the original file, and saves it as a new file.

File_display_on_screen.c reads a block of data from a file into memory, and then displays the data on screen.

Find_max_and_min_in_arrays.c initializes an array, and gets the maximum and minimum values of the array.

Input_floating_point_numbers_from_stream.c gets a number from the stream stdin, and displays it on screen as a floating point number.

Multiple_strings_concatenation.c uses a function with a variable argument list, and concatenates an arbitrary number of strings.

Occurrence_of_letters_in_strings.c counts the occurrence of each letter in a string.

Pause_for_5sec.c gives a pause for five seconds, showing a dot on screen for each second elapsed.

Print_array_elements.c sets a pointer to an array, and uses the pointer to print the elements in the array.

Search_string_within_another.c searches for a target string within another string, showing all occurrences of the target string.

Simple_calculator.c performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two arguments.

Sort_numbers_in_order.c sorts the numbers in an array, and it allows the user to choose whether to sort in an ascending or a descending order.

Sort_strings_in_order.c takes a number of strings as arguments, and stops when a certain string is entered. Then it sorts the strings in ascending order.

Store_and_display_names.c lets users input their names, and show them in a neat format.

String_length_comparison.c compares the length of two strings, and shows the longer string on screen.
